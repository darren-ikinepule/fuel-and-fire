## Fuel & Fire: Project Overview

Welcome to the core details of "Fuel & Fire," the app designed to ignite your fitness awareness with a sleek, edgy, and sporty vibe!

## Problem Statement

Many people find it hard to grasp how much exercise is needed to burn off fast-food calories, creating a gap between their eating habits and fitness goals or just general curiosity.
Fuel & Fire solves this by visually translating fast-food consumption into relatable exercise, making calorie awareness fun and motivating.

## Wow-Factor

The wow-factor of Fuel & Fire lies in its ability to instantly transform abstract calorie counts into relatable, real-world exercise challenges, presented with a visually striking and motivating interface.

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

## User Story 1: Food Selection & Calorie Display

As a user, I want to easily select one or more fast-food items from a visually appealing list, so that I can see their combined calorie count.

## Acceptance Criteria:

On the food selection screen, clicking a fast-food item visually indicates that it is selected (e.g., with an orange border/glow).
Clicking a selected item again should deselect it.
As I select/deselect items, the total calorie count for the selected items should update dynamically and be clearly displayed.
The food items should be presented with their image, name, and individual calorie count.

## User Story 2: Personalized Exercise Calculation

As a user, I want to input my weight, so that the app can accurately calculate personalized exercise durations needed to burn off the selected calories.

## Acceptance Criteria:

After selecting one or more fast-food items, entering my weight (in kg) and submitting it should display a list of different exercises (e.g., running, walking, cycling) with the specific duration required for each, based on my weight and the total calories.
The exercise results should be clearly formatted and easy to understand.
If no food is selected or weight is not entered, an informative message should prompt me to do so before displaying results.

## User Story 3: Engaging Visual Feedback

As a user, I want the app to provide a visually engaging and consistent experience, so that I feel motivated and enjoy using it.

## Acceptance Criteria:

All elements (backgrounds, headings, borders, interactive states) should consistently adhere to the gloss black and fluorescent orange theme.
The overall aesthetic should convey an edgy and sporty feel through its design choices (e.g., strong contrasts, subtle glows, bold typography).
Interactive elements (buttons, selected food items) should provide clear visual feedback on hover, focus, and selection.

## User Story 4: Responsive Layout

As a user, I want the app to look good and be fully functional on various devices, so that I can use it comfortably whether on my phone or desktop.

## Acceptance Criteria:

On a mobile device (e.g., phone portrait/landscape), all content should be appropriately sized and laid out without horizontal scrolling.
On a tablet or desktop, the layout should adapt to utilize the screen space effectively, maintaining readability and usability.

## User Story 5: Intuitive Impact Understanding (Non-Numerical User)

As someone who doesn't understand complex numbers or fitness terms, I want to easily grasp the physical effort needed to balance out my fast-food choices, so that I can make simple, positive decisions for my health.

## Acceptance Criteria:

When I select a food item, the app should provide a simplified, non-numerical representation of its energy content (e.g., a visual "energy level" indicator or a relative size comparison).
Instead of precise calorie numbers, the app should suggest easy-to-understand physical activities (e.g., "a brisk walk","jogging","swimming") and their approximate duration, without showing exact minutes or precise MET values initially.
The app should offer encouraging, non-technical feedback that reinforces positive choices.
